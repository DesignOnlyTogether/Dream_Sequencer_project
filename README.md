## Description

Description the project and exhibition : We can learn much from our past dreams and aspirations; some become realities, 
while others remain unfulfilled wishes. What can we learn from our past dreams, and what do we dream about now? 
How do we envision our future, and what do we think future generations will dream of? In this project, 
participants interact with the ‘Dream Sequencer’ to reflect on the evolution of our dreams through time and to discuss design’s role as a form of future-making.
